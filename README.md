Do you like reading www.pbfcomics.com so much that you'd like those comics saved offline? Me too! That's why I wrote this little script.

Running it is trivial: create a directory you want your comics to go into, like "mkdir pbfcomics". Then call the script on that directory, like "python pbfdler.py pbfcomics/".
